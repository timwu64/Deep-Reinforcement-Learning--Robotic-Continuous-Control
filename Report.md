## Introduction

In this project, I built the reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the
continues action spaces

1.  Unity\'s 20 agents Reacher environment

2.  Unity\'s 12 agents Crawler environment

In the following sessions of the report, I summarized how to build,
implement, fine tune and improve the learning of DDPG and Twin Delayed
DDPG agent and how I selected best agent.

Reacher

-   I am able to solve the Reacher environment (version2, with 20
    identical agents) in 273 episodes with average score 30.11 with DDPG
    agent

Crawler

-   I am able to try the Crawler environment with Twin Delayed DDPG agent and see the upper trend of average score

## Reacher Environment (Version 2: 20 Agents)
In the Reacher Environment has 2 separate versions

1.  The first version contains a single agent

2.  The second version contains 20 identical agents, and each of the
    agent has its own copy of the environment

In this project, I choose the second version to solve the environment.

### Code Location

-   The Agent Class implemented in the (ddpg\_agent.py)

-   The Deep Q-Network model implemented in the file (model.py)

-   The model training and etc. implemented in the
    (Continuous\_Control.ipynb)

-   The model weights are saved in the (Reacher\_ckpt\_path) folder

### Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) Implementation**

The solution is based on DDPG architecture

The (Actor Critic) Network Architecture and Agent Hyperparameters

\[MODEL INFO\] Actor initialized with parameters:

state\_size=33

action\_size=4

seed=123

fc1\_units=128

fc2\_units=128

\[MODEL INFO\] CRITIC initialized with parameters:

state\_size=33

action\_size=4

seed=123

fcs1\_units=128

fc2\_units=128

The Agent Hyperparameters:

\[AGENT INFO\] DDPG constructor initialized parameters:

\# Set parameters for training

seed = 123 \# random seed number

n\_episodes\_max = 1000 \# number of training episodes

max\_t = 1000 \# number of timesteps per episode

actor\_fc1\_units = 128 \# actor network hidden layer \#1 number of unit

actor\_fc2\_units = 128 \# actor network hidden layer \#2 number of unit

critic\_fcs1\_units = 128 \# critic network hidden layer \#1 number of
unit

critic\_fc2\_units = 128 \# critic network hidden layer \#2 number of
unit

BUFFER\_SIZE = int(1e6) \# replay buffer size

BATCH\_SIZE = 128 \# minibatch size

GAMMA = 0.99 \# discount factor

TAU = 1e-3 \# for soft update of target parameters

LR\_ACTOR = 2e-4 \# learning rate of the actor

LR\_CRITIC = 2e-4 \# learning rate of the critic

WEIGHT\_DECAY = 0.00 \# L2 weight decay

OU\_MU = 0.0 \# OUNoise mu

OU\_THETA = 0.15 \# OUNoise theta

OU\_SIGMA = 0.18 \# OUNoise sigma

UPDATE\_EVERY\_T\_STEPS = 20 \# timesteps between updates

NUM\_OF\_UPDATES = 10 \# num of update passes when updating

actor\_ckpt\_path = \'Reacher\_ckpt\_path/checkpoint\_actor.pth\'

critic\_ckpt\_path = \'Reacher\_ckpt\_path/checkpoint\_critic.pth\'

### Results

The best performing agent can solve the environment in 273 episodes. The
file with the saved model weights of the best agent saved in the
checkpoint folder Reacher\_ckpt\_path and named checkpoint\_actor.pth
,checkpoint\_critic.pth

### The Best Agent Reacher Result:

Episode 100 (24min) Moving Average Score (over time window): 3.24

Episode 200 (50min) Moving Average Score (over time window): 16.59

Environment solved in 273 episodes! Average Score: 30.11

### Future Improvements

1.  Extensive hyperparameter optimization, fine tune the experience
    replay feeding buffer size and update frequency

2.  Add prioritized experience replay

3.  Apply more advance model like Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
